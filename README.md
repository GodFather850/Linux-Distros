> "I don't want my desktop to dance. I want it to **work** — fast, clean, focused." – Me after testing too many DEs 😂

As a 17-year-old self-taught developer from Iran (Lua for MTA:SA, Bash automation, Python scripting, limited internet, GitHub commits anyway), I tested multiple Linux distributions and desktop environments to find what actually helps me **code faster** instead of fighting the system.

This repo is my honest, no-BS review — what worked, what sucked, and what I recommend.

## Distributions I Tested

| Distro          | Stability | Ease of Use | Package Manager | Best For                          | My Verdict (1–10) | Recommendation |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Ubuntu          | ★★★★☆     | ★★★★☆       | apt + snap       | Beginners, daily dev              | 8/10              | Great starter  |
| Debian 13 (Trixie) | ★★★★★   | ★★★★☆       | pure apt         | Stability, servers, serious work  | 9.5/10            | **My current main** |
| Arch Linux      | ★★☆☆☆     | ★☆☆☆☆       | pacman           | Extreme customization learners    | 4/10              | Avoid unless masochist |
| EndeavourOS     | ★★★☆☆     | ★★★☆☆       | pacman           | KDE lovers, tinkerers             | 6/10              | Only if you love rice |
| Kali Linux      | ★★☆☆☆     | ★★★☆☆       | apt              | Pentesting / security only        | 5/10 (daily use)  | VM only – not daily |
| Pop!_OS         | ★★★★☆     | ★★★★☆       | apt              | Gaming + dev                      | 8.5/10            | Excellent if you game |

## Desktop Environments Ranked (by my taste: speed & minimalism)

| DE          | RAM Idle (approx) | Customization | Animations/Fluff | Focus Level | My Score | Final Verdict |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------|------------------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| LXQt        | ~400–600 MB       | ★★★☆☆         | Almost none      | ★★★★★       | 9.5/10   | **Winner for me** – pure speed |
| XFCE        | ~500–750 MB       | ★★★★☆         | Very little      | ★★★★☆       | 9/10     | Extremely close second – love it |
| COSMIC      | ~700–1000 MB      | ★★★★☆         | Moderate         | ★★★★☆       | 8/10     | Modern & nice for gaming |
| GNOME       | ~1–1.5 GB         | ★★★☆☆ (extensions) | Yes            | ★★★☆☆       | 7/10     | Good but heavy |
| KDE Plasma  | ~800 MB–1.5 GB    | ★★★★★         | Lots             | ★★☆☆☆       | 5/10     | Too much → overwhelming |

## My Current Setup (2026)

- **Base**: Debian 13 (Trixie)  
- **Display Manager**: LightDM  
- **Main DE**: LXQt (daily driver)  
- **Backup DE**: XFCE (when I want a bit more panels/menu)  
- **Tools**: VS Code (Settings Sync + GitHub), tmux, git, python3, lua, bash, htop, neofetch 😄

## Quick Advice for Devs Like Me

- Want **stability**? → Debian 13 or Ubuntu LTS  
- Want **speed & zero distractions**? → LXQt or XFCE  
- Gaming + dev? → Pop!_OS with COSMIC  
- Love rice/customization? → EndeavourOS + KDE  
- Security tools only? → Kali in VM  
- Avoid Arch unless you have time to burn
